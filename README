This project is meant to enable use of subtitle files (*.srt) in streamed video that the user doesn't own.

In such cases, where the user cannot change the video to add subtitles, Subtitles Runner can be used to display the subtitles loaded from a file on top of the streamed video.

The application is Alpha stage - basic functionality works, but there is still lots of work to make it really usable.
